# The New York City Civilian Complaint Review Board (CCRB) 

CCRB is an independent agency that receives, investigates, mediates, hears, make findings, and recommends actions on complaints against NYPD officers. Complaints range from the use of excessive or unnecessary force, abuse of authority, discourtesy, or the use of offensive language.  

**import.R**: imports and cleans CCRB data for closed complaints cases ranging from 2000-2017. 

*The complaint filing date was not included in the dataset so this was estimated using the closed year and days since the complanit was received.
